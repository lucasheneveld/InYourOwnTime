Our reasoning behind doing an application largely stemmed from determining what platform would be the most effective for accomplishing the purpose of timing fitness activity. We wanted our app to be intuitive and have a relatively aesthetic and minimalistic user interface. We designed the app by incorporating some of the same methodologies used to make the standard timers and stopwatches that are use to create the standard appl clock app. 

We use different colors for the buttons like login and sign up since the contrast makes the app more easily readable and usable. Users have the option of making a default timer with one interval of exercise and rest and also the option of creating a new set of intervals and naming the custom timer. 

We found a way to design an aesthetic backgroun by making an animated clock that both accurately displays the time and serves as the general graphic that describes the application. This moving backgraound was largely a stylistic touch, and it would only appear after logging into the app.

With our registration, we used the standard practice where users choose a username and must both choose and confirm their password view repetition. Each cell is labeled with the input that it expects to receive in order to make the app as easy as possible for users to utilize. 

Throughout the project we consulted available resources to learn swift techniques and applied things we learned in past psets like the finance pset in order to implement components like an effective login.
